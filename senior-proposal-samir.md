# Seniors Spring Intensive Deliverable Proposal 

Dates 3/16-3/25

**My Name:** Jonasz Rice, Samir Ingle

**Project Name:** Clary

**Is your project New or Old?** Old

**Is your project Solo or Team?** Team


## Description

**Write a paragraph summary of the current status of your project, what you hope to achieve during the intensive, how and why**
the project we were originally working on is a Deep Learning audio generator which allows us to create music after training it on different songs, genres, samples, etc.... However this proved to be a huge task - we are only focusing on the music production part for now since that was our biggest blindspot
We planned on a much larger app before for a previous INT but it was a much larger scope than we could accomplish so 
this is a smaller section of it - just for generating midi files in a helpful sequence. 

## Objective 1: midi-generator feature

**Why do you want to meet this objective? How will it improve your project?** 
Allows us to compose different notes to create music.

**How will you demonstrate completion of your objective?** 
We will create atleast one 4 bar midi file

## Objective 2: Multiple tracks
**Why do you want to meet this objective? How will it improve your project?** 
Combining midi files allows us to compose music as we wish

**How will you demonstrate completion of your objective?** 

## Objective 3: Playback for midi tracks
**Why do you want to meet this objective? How will it improve your project?** 
We want to be able to create actual music files which we can play outloud, save,
and make changes to. 

**How will you demonstrate completion of your objective?** 
Atleast one playable midi file

## Stretch goals (optional):

**What stretch goals do you have for your project?**
We'd like to hopefully be able to implement a deep learning model down the road to
create our own generated music trained from whoever we want.
