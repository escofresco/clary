## Description

**Write a paragraph summary of the current status of your project, what you hope to achieve during the intensive, how and why**
This project has been planned for a while. It is unstarted, but I have a very clear idea of where to take it.

## Objective 1: Composition: MIDI Generation

**Why do you want to meet this objective? How will it improve your project?** 
This is the basis for composing music in the app. Since this app is intended for people with little to no technical skills, a core principle is accessibility. Automating composition is a good place to start.

**How will you demonstrate completion of your objective?** 
1-bar midi is playable and stochastic.

## Objective 2: Arrangement: Multiple Tracks
**Why do you want to meet this objective? How will it improve your project?** 
Being able to combine multiple audio tracks together enables the arrangment of instruments or different components like percussion, melody, etc.

**How will you demonstrate completion of your objective?** 
Playback will occur for accross midi tracks.

## Objective 3: Engineering: Sound FX
**Why do you want to meet this objective? How will it improve your project?** 
This is the butter of music production. Since MIDI doesn't hold information about how notes should sound, everything about the audio in this project is created in software. On a separate note, arranging multiple tracks together can introduce artifacts that need to be corrected for.

**How will you demonstrate completion of your objective?** Atleast one property of sound will be mutable.

## Stretch goals (optional):

**What stretch goals do you have for your project?** Pleasant visual
